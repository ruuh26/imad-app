            Before you get mad and say that i forgot ur birthday, i want to say that i remembered as soon as the clock was ticking 12 o'clock.<br/>
            The only thing was that i wanted to wish you in a little different way and the webpage was not complete by 12 a.m.<br/>
            So i just got little late. Hope you won't be mad.
            I am in the last few toches and soon you will see it.<br/>
            Thank you for being my sister. Not just you, choti also. You two means a world to me.</br>
            I changed the colour of the text to <b>pink</b>. Your favourite colour na..!!!
