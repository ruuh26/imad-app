            I assume that u see the changes in this page. Of course these changes ought to be there, atleast today.
            Sorry the domain name doesnt look good, couldn't afford a better one.
                U might be feeling that he is talking non-sense, but i had to write something something so that the page doesn't look 
            completely empty.HeHeHeHe.<br/>
            
            There's a "next" on the top left corner.
            It's too confusing to decide which colour of the text will look better.
            Black colour is too difficult to read over ur photo. 
            Red doesn't look good, neither white.
            Yeah, i think purple is fine. What do u say??
            NEXT is waiting!!
