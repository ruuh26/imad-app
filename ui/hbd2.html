            Hope I am not boring u with my words. I created 4-5 pages, so  utilizing the most of the places to write.
            If possible take an hour or two out of your busy schedule and go out and enjoy with your friends. It won't hamper 
            your studies much. Have fun with them, cut the cake (save a bite for me). Even if you don't have that much of time,
            you can go to a nearby temple if you like going to temple.
